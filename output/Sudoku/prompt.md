### ✅ **Prompt:**

> You are a software architect, building for a modern web.
>
> Create a simple yet elegant Sudoku web application.
> Follow modern best practices: use reusable components, separation of concerns, semantic HTML, clean CSS, and modular JavaScript or a component-based framework if applicable (e.g., React or Vue).
>
> Requirements:
> - Display a 9x9 Sudoku board, pre-filled with a few numbers
> - Allow the user to fill in numbers in empty cells
> - Validate the user's input (real-time or on submit)
> - A “Check” button that validates the solution
> - A “Reset” button to restart the puzzle
>
> Use your judgment for design: clean, minimalist, mobile-friendly.
>
> Structure the code in a way that makes future expansion easy: e.g., the ability to add multiple puzzles or a difficulty selector.
>
> Include all necessary HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — either inline or in separated sections.
>
> Make sure to comment the code for clarity. Save the output as a markdown file named `sudoku.md` in `/home/zhuo/OpenManus/output/Sudoku/`.
