# Sisyphus

**Characters:**
*   Socrates
*   Moron (A seeker of wisdom, perhaps ironically named)

**Setting:** The Athenian Agora, near the statue of Hermes.

**(Scene opens with Socrates and Moron engaged in conversation.)**

**Socrates:** Tell me, Moron, what occupies your thoughts this fine morning?

**Moron:** Socrates, I find myself troubled by the nature of existence. It seemsâ€¦ absurd.

**Socrates:** Absurd, you say? Explain yourself, lest I misunderstand your meaning.

**Moron:** Well, consider the farmer. He toils endlessly, planting seeds, tending to his crops, all in the hope of a harvest. Yet, a drought may come, or a plague of locusts, and all his efforts are rendered meaningless. Is this not absurd?

**Socrates:** Indeed, fortune can be fickle. But does the possibility of misfortune negate the value of the farmer's labor?

**Moron:** Perhaps not entirely. But consider the statesman, striving for justice and the betterment of the city. He makes laws, wages wars, and seeks to guide the populace. Yet, his motives are questioned, his actions misinterpreted, and ultimately, he is often reviled or forgotten. Is this not also absurd?

**Socrates:** The path of the statesman is fraught with difficulty, and the judgment of the people is often swayed by passion. Yet, is the pursuit of justice itself not a noble endeavor, regardless of its outcome?

**Moron:** Even if noble, Socrates, consider the philosopher! He spends his life in contemplation, seeking truth and wisdom. He questions everything, challenges assumptions, and strives to understand the fundamental nature of reality. Yet, the more he learns, the more he realizes how little he truly knows. Is this not the most absurd of all?

**Socrates:** (Smiling) Ah, Moron, you strike at the heart of the matter. The philosopher, indeed, is acutely aware of the limits of human knowledge. But is the awareness of our ignorance not itself a form of wisdom? Is the journey of inquiry not more valuable than the attainment of a final, definitive answer?

**Moron:** But what is the *point*, Socrates? If all our striving is ultimately futile, if our efforts are subject to chance, and if our knowledge is ever incomplete, why bother at all? Why not simply embrace the chaos and indulge in pleasure, as the Sophists suggest?

**Socrates:** (Pauses, stroking his beard) The question of "point," Moron, is itself a question. What is the point of a perfectly crafted vase if it is destined to be broken? What is the point of a beautiful flower if it is destined to wither? The point, my friend, lies not in the permanence or the guaranteed success of our endeavors, but in the *manner* in which we undertake them.

**Moron:** The manner? You mean the *arete*, the virtue?

**Socrates:** Precisely. The farmer who toils with diligence and skill, even if his crops fail, has still cultivated virtue. The statesman who strives for justice with integrity and courage, even if his efforts are thwarted, has still acted virtuously. And the philosopher who pursues truth with humility and perseverance, even if he never fully grasps it, has still lived a life of virtue. It is in this pursuit of excellence, in this striving for virtue, that we find meaning, even in the face of the absurd.

**Moron:** So, the meaning is not *in* the result, but *in* the striving itself?

**Socrates:** Indeed. The gods may laugh at our efforts, fortune may conspire against us, and the universe may remain ultimately mysterious. But we can still choose to live with virtue, with courage, and with a commitment to excellence. And in that choice, we find a meaning that transcends the absurd.

**Moron:** I begin to understand, Socrates. It is not the *what* but the *how* that matters. Thank you for your wisdom.

**Socrates:** The pursuit of wisdom is a lifelong journey, Moron. May your own path be filled with virtue, even amidst the absurdities of life.

**(Socrates and Moron exit the stage.)**
